	<div class="goblettext"><p>Typography is like a fine wine and should be enjoyed as such. Are you noticing the type that I am using currently? Or are you just reading and processing the words, not thinking about the type? It is a nice sans serif; easy to read, legible, and simple. Many people don't notice anything particularily interesting about this; and that is fine! The simplest typography is usually the cleanest, which helps your point stand out. With simple, clean typography, this can help express what you want, without distracting the viewer. It is like the goblet; with the beautiful golden one, you may feel fancy, but you cannot see the delectable wine inside of it. With the transparent crystal one, you can see every single colour and shade, while still showing elegance.

	If we used some papyrus, how do you feel now about this type? Does it still flow well, or is it jarring, irritating to try to read? Does this size intimdate you? Make you feel something? ANGER?

	<p><br><br>The best typography flows, and reads well. I found some examples online of how meaning can change depending on the typography.
