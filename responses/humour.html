		Making things on the internet feel relatable and human is a difficult thing to do. When everything is behind screens, it is hard to imagine someone else out there, creating what you are seeing. I think this is why many people have a problem with paying artists for their time and work; all some people see is the final product. <span class="humanbold">“That can’t take too long”</span>, some say, as they try to justify a low or free price point. <span class="humanbold">“I could get my child to do this”</span>, even though it will not be proper. <span class="humanbold">“You’ll get lots of exposure”</span>, which doesn’t pay the bills. People only see the end result; not the time, the practice, the schooling, that makes up the price point that artists put. </p>

		<p>When artists make their websites personal and representational of themselves, it brings a comforting feeling, like seeing the true vision of the person. It’s like learning about them without conversing with them. Humour can help with this at all. It lightens the mood and makes people feel comfortable. With all of these together, it brings a human aspect to the dull RGB world displayed on the screen. </p>
