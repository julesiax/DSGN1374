		<h2>
			What made you want to study graphic design?
		</h2>

				<p>
					I wanted to study graphic design because I wanted to improve my design skills and it’s one of those things that makes me happy while doing it. In high school, art and communications technology were my favourite courses, so I said to myself, why not take a program that is 100% design and shows off my creative skills?

		<h2>
			What was the most important thing you learned from these courses?
		</h2>

				<p>
					The most important thing I learn from these courses is that type can make or break a design. I never realized how much thought had to go into choosing the proper font for your audience and designs, and that choice can make it marketable or not. Thanks Greg!

		<h2>
			Did you feel like Niagara College delivered a satisfactory design course?
		</h2>

				<p>
					My time at Niagara College was great and I learned so much about design and the graphic design field. Being in the field now shows me how much of what we learned carried over and I’m now using on a daily basis. The one thing I wish I learned more about was paper types and dealing with printing companies. That has become something I’m trying to teach myself everyday at my job that I wish we covered more over the three years.

		<h2>
			What is your favourite program to work with?
		</h2>
		<div class="container">

			<div class="middle">
				<p>
					It’s a toss up between Illustrator and InDesign. If you asked me a year ago when I was in my third year I would say InDesign hands down. But Illustrator is just so easy to use and create graphics with. InDesign feels more organized though, and when I’m using the program, it’s easy to duplicate full pages and spreads around.

		<h2>
			How do you stay inspired?
		</h2>
		<div class="container">

			<div class="middle">
				<p>
					Staying inspired can be super difficult when you’re in a bed mental state ,or just clueless to what the client is asking for in a design. I find that discussing ideas or asking friends for input really helps. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Also Pinterest and Behance are nice sites to look through.

		<h2>
			How do you stay confident with your work?
		</h2>
		<div class="container">

			<div class="middle">
				<p>
					Staying confident in my work can be tough. I could leave work feeling really proud of what I’m working on and then come back in the next morning and want to restart. Again, talking to friends can help boost confidence. Getting a fresh pair of eyes to look at the work you have spent hours working on can be refreshing. Or family, they can’t say they hate anything, it’s the family law.

		<h2>
			Do you have any strategies to overcome criticism, and not take it personally?
		</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<img src="img/unlucky4.png" alt="A white typeface on a black background" class="image">
			<div class="middle">
				<p>
					My strategy for dealing with criticism and not taking it personally is to separate yourself as a person from your work. They don’t hate you because they hate your design, It could dislike it because of the style or colours used. Criticism is good because it makes you grow stronger as a person and a designer.

		<h2>
			Where do you want to go with your design career?
		</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<img src="img/um2.png" alt="A mockup of a magazine insert featuring Leah Fay from July Talk" class="image">
			<div class="middle">
				<p>
					I would love to work for a larger company with a brand style already created or join a team that needs to create a brand style. I want to be an in-house designer instead of working for a design firm that outsources to other companies. 
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h2>
			Are there any fields that you want to learn more about within the design industry?
		</h2>
		<div class="container">
			<img src="img/menu.png" alt="A menu for Blue Star restaurant" class="image">
			<div class="middle">
				<p>
					Since graduating from Niagara, I’ve been doing a lot of web programming and building which I never thought I would do. Something just clicked over the summer where things just started to make sense. It would be nice to take more courses, learn more about programming, and enhance my skills in that field.
				</p>

		<h2>
			How has it been, now that you have worked in the design industry outside of school?
		</h2>
		<div class="container">

			<div class="middle">
				<p>
					Being out of school and in the design field has had its ups and downs. Starting out I definitely didn’t feel ready to be in the work field, but like everything, it takes time to get comfortable in a new place and thrive. I actually missed being in lectures and not having to do anything except take in information and work on my thesis. For work, I definitely had to change my mind set on how I worked on projects. I can’t design clients projects the way I would want it to look, I have to think like them and design what they would want to see. But then when they sign off on projects and you get to see all your hard work on their products, it’s a surreal moment.
