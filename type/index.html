	We were kind of feral, wicked little machines. Captains and Cavalries forming empires in the shade of the trees. Without hesitation, kings of the forest town. Holding the ocean down. We were half this heavy and twice this loud. So turn up the noise. Dressed to the nines. Running with the boys. Your hand in mine. Singing every song, Loving every line. 'Til the night is gone. Just like the old times. Just like the old times. Was what you made it. We had our friends around. All the images and sounds, Super imposing to old backgrounds. We used to be clumsy, lost in a thousand ways. Captivated by the craze, Those were hands down My favorite days. So turn up the noise. Dressed to the nines. Running with the boys. Your hand in mine. Singing every song, Loving every line. 'Til the night is gone. Just like the old times. Just like the old times. Suspicion wasn't in our heads. It was only underneath the beds, beds. Saline eyes didn't have to hide. They were always open way too wide, way too wide. So turn up the noise. Dressed to the nines. Running with the boys. Your hand in mine. Singing every song, Loving every line. 'Til the night is gone. Just like the old times
